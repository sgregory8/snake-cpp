# snake-cpp
Snake written in the console using curses

## TODO

1. Fix the generation of a new food point, it will bug out (suspected) if the next food point is contained within the current snake body
2. Collision is a bit broken in certain circumstances (interaction with head and body part 2?)
3. The state at which the terminal is left sometimes. Indentation of lines?!?!?
